  - alt: Depiction of the myth of the Sword of Damocles. The sword of Damocles is a
      saying that means a person is constantly in danger. According to Greek
      legend, the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius the Elder (432-367 BC) offered the
      throne for a day to his courtier, Damocles, who considered the tyrant the
      luckiest man and was jealous of him. During the feast, when he saw a sharp
      sword hanging over his head on a horseshoe, Damocles understood the
      fragility of the ruler's happiness and prosperity.
